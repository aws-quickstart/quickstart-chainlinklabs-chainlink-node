For troubleshooting common Partner Solution issues, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

=== I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Partner Solution.

If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

=== I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

Launch the Partner Solution templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

=== What other environment variables can I add to my Chainlink node?

For a list of environment variables and their explanations, refer to https://docs.chain.link/docs/configuration-variables/[Configuration Variables^].

=== I encountered an 'Error reading password: open /chainlink/.password: no such file or directory' error message when starting my Chainlink node.

Make sure that the .password files exist inside the Chainlink root directory. If the .password file does not exist, run the following command to create the .password file:

....
cd /home/ec2-user/.chainlink/ && ./create-password.sh \
$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id WalletSecret --query "SecretString" --output text)
....

=== I encountered a 'Creating application: parse "XXXXXX": invalid URI for request' error message when starting my Chainlink node.

This error typically happens when a parsing error exists within the PostgreSQL connection string (postgresql://) in the DATABASE_URL variable. Double-check the .env file for any errors in format or spelling. You can manually edit the connection string or run the following command to create a new .env file:

....
cd /home/ec2-user/.chainlink/ && ./create-env.sh \
${chainNetwork} \
${blockchainNodeUrl} \
${psqlUser} \
$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id DBSecret --query "SecretString" --output text) \
${psqlHostname} \
${psqlPort} \
${psqlDb}
....
